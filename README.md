# Python library to interact with LEGO Move Hub

Requires `gattlib` to be installed, currently Python 2.7 only

Best way to start is to look at [demo.py](demo.py) file, and run it.

## Features

- auto-detect and connect for Bluetooth device
- auto-detects devices connected to Hub
- permanent Bluetooth connection server for faster debugging
- angled and timed movement for motors
- LED color change

## Ideas

Make it 2/3 compatible
Add travis unit tests and coverage
